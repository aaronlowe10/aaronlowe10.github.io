              <img src="images/ball/in-use.png" alt="Rehabilitation ball in use">
              <p>For my second-year project, I was assigned a brief to make a product that would help the aging community, my grand dad had recently suffered a stroke so I put all my passion into making something that would benefit people that have suffered from a similar situation.</p>
              <img src="images/ball/design.png" alt="">
              <p>After much extensive researching and controlled observations, I realised that most people that suffer from a stroke lose a great deal of dexterity in their hands, this prevents them from doing things they would have previously considered normal everything things, this typically led to frustration and anger. I wanted to make something to help them recover as fast as possible.</p>
              <img src="images/ball/3d-design.png" alt="">
              <p>Through my research I discovered that the squeezing motion was the most soothing motion that used a personâ€™s hands and was commonly used in rehabilitation therapy. This is what led me to create a stress ball.</p>
              <img src="images/ball/ring.png" alt="">
              <p>My stress ball is very unique from every other stress ball, for two main reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>There is a pressure pad inside the ball that measures how hard you squeeze the ball and then displays this information in an easy to read and understand manner, the reason this is so special to the product is that it encourages the user to get a big number, during my testing, having this screen in front of the person made them want to get the biggest number they could, constantly wanting to beat themselves as if it was a game. This gamifies the whole experience, making them want to improve, and by improving they are recovering.</li>
                <li>The most special part of this design is the material choice. The outside ball is made from thin silicone rubber, and the inside is made from Ooblek. To me this is what makes it so special, ooblek is a non- Newtonian fluid, essentially the greater the force being applied to it is, the harder it becomes. I thought this was a really exciting idea because the ball is constantly adapting to user, no matter the user baseline strength the ball will react accordingly, if at first the user struggles to clench their fist together the material will act like water, as they get stronger it will become more dense and viscous.</li>
              </ul>
              <img src="images/ball/dials.png" alt="">
              <p>The product can be used by everyone, no matter their strength, and the ball will constantly adapt and change to the specific person using it, making it a perfect recover tool that I believe could help thousands of people one day.</p>

              <h3>Embedding Micro Controllers</h3>
              <img src="images/micro-controllers/Arduino-wired.jpg" alt="">
              <p>This module required me to learn an entirely new set of skills. We were tasked with creating a bike light, specifically; the coding required to make it do several different things, the electronics required to make it work and the inclusive deign which was considering how it would all fit together and be securely contained within a box.</p>
              <img src="images/micro-controllers/Code.jpg" alt="">
              <p>I was given an Arduino to use, this is effectively a small programmable computer, if you program something correctly and wire it correctly with the right components it can perform an enormous number of simple tasks.</p>
              <img src="images/micro-controllers/circuit-board-fixing.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Powered by an ATMega328 we had to program a high-powered LED to have 4 separate modes, I accomplished this using different cases, the first case was keeping the high-powered LED on at full light level. The second required a light dependant resistor that would alter the light level of the LED based on the ambient light level in the room. The third case was keeping the LED flashing between 1hz and 4hz, and the fourth needed to flash at a drastically different rate to the other case cases. Before all the cases it would first have to pass a confidence test, to complete this I used a standard green LED, once the power was applied to the circuit it would blink 3 times before stopping, thus showing that the software was working. One of the most important things I had to consider was restricting the current using resistors to protect each component used while still allowing enough current around the system to functional nominally.<p>
              <img src="images/micro-controllers/button-enclosure.jpg" alt="">
              <p>We then had to move the ATMega328 off the Arduino and create our own circuit that would allow everything to work as if it was still attached to the Arduino, capacitors and crystals made this possible. Once the circuit was made I had to create an enclosure, the important thing was to make each component secure including; the confidence LED, high powered LED, LDR, battery pack and the main circuit board. Each component had to be in an appropriate location that made logical sense and exposing the components necessary, such as having the high-powered LED pointing forwards.<p>

              <img src="images/first-year-small-projects/first-mouse.jpg" alt="">
              <p>The first few weeks of starting University were a series of small assignments to introduce us to the course and the equipment available to us.</p>
              <img src="images/first-year-small-projects/second-mouse.jpg" alt="">
              <p>The first assignment was a mouse, we used many different model making techniques to make a sleek and smooth free form shape. The best result was from; carving the shape of the mouse out of Styrofoam, sealing the surface of the model, covering it in a thin layer of clay and smoothing until perfect. After setting in the oven they were ready to have the final finishes, such as further smoothing, priming, spray painting and flocking. After the first model, I created a second, more refined version eliminating some of the things I think needed improving from the first design.</p>
              <img src="images/first-year-small-projects/candle-holder.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Next we created a candle stick, this was quick assignment to introduce solid works and how to use a lathe.</p>
              <img src="images/first-year-small-projects/tiles.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Our final assignment was bathroom tiles, I conducted research on patterns because I wanted the wall tiles to be interesting, this led me to create 3D tiles that slightly stick out of the wall making them unique. To make several copies of the same tile, I created a die by making the pattern out of MDF and vacuum forming over it, this made it easy to make several perfect copies very quickly.</p>
              <img src="images/first-year-small-projects/speaker-final-image-1.jpg" alt="">
              <p>The final project was a group project, the brief was to create a promotional gift that would fit through a letter box, my group of three people decided to create a passive amplifier for peoples phones, we thought this would be a great promotional gift because there was a massive festival in Brighton called wildlife, we had the idea that they would be able to stay in their tents and play music when they are done with the festival music, however a big issue is that phones are normally too quiet, this amp allows them to increase the maximum volume of the music playing without the use of any electronics. Most sound is lost due to the sound waves bouncing off objects and spreading all around the room, this shape forces the sound waves down its chamber and releases them in each direction which makes it sound significantly louder. The record on top has several different sized holes, these holes are for different sized phones, so no matter what phone you have, the phone would be able to sit in the speaker.<p>

              <img src="" alt="">
              <p>This was the first major project we were given at university; the brief was to make a product that incorporates a heating element. I decided to make a kettle because I had an interesting idea that I wanted to explore in greater detail: using electromagnetic conduction as a new way of efficiently heating water.<p>
              <p>Most kettles in a modern-day kitchen use an ordinary conduction system, typically there was a copper coil or plate around the bottom of the kettle, when a current ran through the metal it was heated up and began to release the energy being stored within its self as heat to the surrounding water, the water being heated would start a flow in the water due the change in energy and density of the water, as the hot water rose to the top the denser, colder water would be pushed to the bottom and would be heated making the flow stronger until all the water had reached its boiling point.</p>
              <p>After a lot of research and testing I found that electromagnetic heating would be a much more efficient option over the traditional conduction heating for several reasons. A significantly smaller amount of energy is lost in an electromagnetic circuit; this means less electricity will be required to heat the same amount of water. One of the main differences was the part being heated, my design had a mild steel rod running through the center of the kettle, this allowed the rod to be heated much quicker than a coil, and the large surface area meant that it would be in contact with more water at once allowing it to heat more water during amount of time.</p>
              <p>This product is a kettle that requires a smaller amount of energy to heat up a body of water, and it does so faster than current alternative options.</p>

              <h3>Engineers Without Borders</h3>
              <p>For this challenge, we were placed into groups and worked together to create a solution to one of Lobitosâ€™s (a small poor district of approximately 1,600 people in Peru) major issues. Lobitos is a fantastic surfing location due to the constant waves and climate, the people of Lobitos earned their income either through the tourists that come to visit for the surfing spot, or fishing.</p>
              <p>In the end, we agreed on creating a Surf shack for the tourists to visit while they enjoy their stay, a place where they can kick back and relax with cold drinks being served to them. This seemed like an excellent opportunity for the people of Lobitos because, by creating a more tourist friendly environment they are bound to attract more attention and receive more visitors, which in turn leads to more money they can invest into their district.</p>
              <p>The district currently has terrible infrastructure and the few facilities they have frequently break down, this meant clean water and electricity were not always available which would cause major issues on the community, however as the community earns more money they should be able to improve and fix the issues plaguing them.</p>
              <p>Due to the electricity being extremely unreliable we decided to create an independent surf shack with its own sustainable energy, Lobitos is known for having strong winds so we decided to harness that using vertical access wind turbines, the system we created is simple to set up and due to the districts history of oil mining there is more than enough materials littering up the streets to create as many turbines as required. The energy produced would lead to a fridge keeping drinks cool for surfers to enjoy. The shape and orientation of the shack is designed to reduce the strong winds from the coast in a gentle breeze that runs through cooling off the guests.</p>

              <h3>Finite Element Analysis</h3>
              <p>For this module, I was given the task of choosing something to analyse using the features offered by solidworks simulations, whatever item or situation I chose to do, we had to optimise it by making small changes and giving evidence that these changes were improving the item.</p>
              <p>I decided to create a bike break disc, it is a common issue in the professional biking industry that brake discs can overheat and/or become deformed due to the excessive heat, once this happens the biker is at risk and could suffer injuries. I wanted to consider the issue to see what factors could decrease the likelihood of this happening.</p>
              <p>Most brake discs currently being made must fit the standard bike, so typically they have a uniform; size, thickness and material. The main factor that could be changed was the pattern of the brake disc.</p>
              <p>To create a worst-case scenario, I calculated the energy that would be applied to the brake disc if a man that weighed in the 95th percentile going a certain speed and stopped within 3 seconds. I created a simple brake disc with the correct dimensions and a simple pattern and applied this energy to the outer edge of the brake disc, thus simulating the brake pads closing on the brake disc. With a few additional figures, I created an accurate transient model of how the brake disc is heated up and cools over a period.</p>
              <p>I conducted 2 other simulations on each model; displacement (stress) test and a bucking test. These were both important simulations because the displacement test would show if the brake disc would deform and if it did, where it would deform and how much by. Buckling is the most extreme thing that could happen but would be a huge risk factor, if an object reaches a point of too much stress it will buckle and instantly collapse, if this happened to a bike the rider would more than likely be injured, to make sure these designs would be safe I implanted a safety factor, if the result doesnâ€™t at least meet the safety factor it would be a failure and unsafe.</p>
              <p>By changing the pattern, I could channel where heat would escape from and reinforce areas that would be under the greatest stress to create a well-designed brake disc.</p>

              <p>During my AS level, I found a client to work for, the client gave me a brief to make a; cheap, modern coffee container that you could expand with more units while being simple and easy to understand.</p>
              <p>The containers each contained to draws, the draws were lined with ABS that was vacuum formed onto each draw, this was to prevent stains on the inside and making it easy to clean by wiping with a dish cloth.</p>
              <p>On the top and sides were a small magnet, these magnets made it easier to attach another unit, if they wanted to expand the container upwards or out to the sides, the magnets would clip into place, however they were weak enough that they could easily be pulled apart and rearranged as the user wants.</p>
              <p>I decided the main boxes would all be made from plywood due to its; high strength, visual aesthetic and that it is cheap. It was likely that these boxes would be knocked and potentially fall, so to make it sturdier I used finger joints to connect each side together. It also compliments the material because it shows off the layers by the join which looks very appealing.</p>
              <p>The acrylic on the front is vibrant and stands out, but not too much that it looks tacky, and by placing more together the user creates a delightful chequered pattern based on which colours they like or dislike, this also allows it to fit into kitchens with different colour schemes, because they can choice what the predominant colour is.</p>
